  abstract = {Life history interviews were conducted with 40 gay and bisexual men to identify modes of syndemic experience and risk practice. Out of the interview narratives emerged one major and two minor modes of developmental pathway whereby syndemic conditions are navigated and expressed: (1) a combination of adverse childhood events with later episodes of depression and/or substantial substance use; (2) personal disruption that led to periods of depression and anxiety associated with the stresses of migration; and (3) a disorientation and an unravelling of life trajectory in the transition from family of origin to college or work. Risk practices fell into three high-risk modes: active and frequent engagement in condomless sex; unassertive deferment to a partner's initiation of condomless sex; and episodic risk combined with a risk reduction strategy. Three low risk modes were also identified: no recent condomlessness but multiple risk history in interview; a trajectory over time from high to low risk; and consistent low risk practice. These different modes of syndemic experience and risk management may have implications for identification of the effective HIV prevention tools that work best for different sets of men.},

  abstract = {Abstract Masculinity is a construct associated with cisgender men; however, transgender men also perform masculinities. This study aimed to synthesize, analyze, and reinterpret the findings of primary qualitative studies about transgender men’s experience of masculinity. The research question developed through the SPIDER strategy was: What is the qualitative evidence of masculinity performed by transgender men? Eighteen studies involving over 200 transgender men between the ages of 19 and 65 were selected. Three descriptive themes emerged: “Bodily performance of masculinity,” “Social performances of masculinity,” and “Sexualities.” Analytical themes were generated: “The appearance of masculinity” and “Far beyond appearance”. The results point to complementary experiences of masculinity: concerning physical appearance and body modifications; and the practices contesting the hegemonic masculinity standard. The experience of masculinities is outlined by body changes, culminating in the passability and social recognition of the transgender man.           ,              Resumo A masculinidade é um constructo associado aos homens cisgêneros; entretanto, homens transgêneros também performam masculinidades. O objetivo deste estudo foi sintetizar, analisar e reinterpretar os achados dos estudos qualitativos primários acerca da experiência da masculinidade de homens transgêneros. A questão de pesquisa, desenvolvida por meio da estratégia SPIDER, foi: Quais são as evidências qualitativas da experiência da masculinidade performada por homens transgêneros? Foram selecionados 18 estudos que envolveram mais de 200 homens transgêneros com idades entre 19 e 65 anos. Emergiram três temas descritivos: “Performances corporais da masculinidade”, “Performances sociais da masculinidade” e “Sexualidades”. Foram gerados os temas analíticos: “A aparência da masculinidade” e “Muito além da aparência”. Os resultados apontam para experiências de masculinidade complementares: relativas à aparência física e às modificações corporais e às práticas contestadoras do padrão de masculinidade hegemônica. A vivência das masculinidades é delineada pelas alterações corporais, culminando na passabilidade e no reconhecimento social do homem transgênero.},

This model, along with gender dysphoria, has been used to explain the disproportionately high rates of psychopathology in transgender individuals when compared to a nontransgender population. The current study further explored the relationships between minority stress, gender dysphoria, and psychopathology and tested a mediation model with minority stress as a predictor variable and gender dysphoria as a mediator on different psychopathologies. One hundred twenty seven Norwegian transgender participants (M = 25.51 years; SD = 8.73) were recruited online. Participants completed standardized questionnaires on minority stress, gender dysphoria, anxiety, depression, and eating pathology. Mediation models were built from a theoretical standpoint using minority stress as a predictor, gender dysphoria as a mediator, and anxiety, depression, and eating pathology as separate outcome variables. The mediation models were significant for all three outcome variables, with gender dysphoria fully mediating only the relationship between minority stress and eating pathologies. Further analyses revealed that age was a significant covariant in the predictive relationships, prompting the sample to be split to young and older participant samples. While lacking power due to reduced participant numbers, these further split-age mediation models suggested that for the younger age group, minority stress appeared to be the highly relevant predictor of all psychopathologies, but in the older age group, gender dysphoria appeared to be the more relevant predictor. Possible explanations for age-group differences, like coping styles, transgender identity formation, and internalized gender roles are discussed.

The presented guidelines are aimed at researchers as well as the broader scientific community, such as reviewers and journal editors evaluating scientific work.

The terms multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary are increasingly used in the literature, but are ambiguously defined and interchangeably used. This paper is the first of two in a series. It discusses the definitions, objectives, and evidence of effectiveness of such teamwork. METHODS: The paper is a literature review based on dictionaries, and Google and MEDLINE (1982-2006) searches. RESULTS: Multidisciplinarity draws on knowledge from different disciplines but stays within their boundaries. Interdisciplinarity analyzes, synthesizes and harmonizes links between disciplines into a coordinated and coherent whole. Transdisciplinarity integrates the natural, social and health sciences in a humanities context, and transcends their traditional boundaries. The objectives of multiple disciplinary approaches are to resolve real world or complex problems, to provide different perspectives on problems, to create comprehensive research questions, to develop concensus clinical definitions and guidelines, and to provide comprehensive health services. Multiple disciplinary teamwork has both benefits and drawbacks. CONCLUSION: The three terms refer to the involvement of multiple disciplines to varying degrees on the same continuum. The common words for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary are additive, interactive, and holistic, respectively. With their own specific meanings, these terms should not be used interchangeably. The more general term "multiple disciplinary" is suggested for when the nature of involvement of multiple disciplines is unknown or unspecified. While multiple disciplinary teamwork is appropriate for complex problems, it is not always necessary in every single project.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the interpersonal theory of suicide has contributed to substantial advances in the scientific and clinical understanding of suicide and related conditions. The interpersonal theory of suicide posits that suicidal desire emerges when individuals experience intractable feelings of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness and near-lethal or lethal suicidal behavior occurs in the presence of suicidal desire and capability for suicide. A growing number of studies have tested these posited pathways in various samples; however, these findings have yet to be evaluated meta-analytically. This paper aimed to (a) conduct a systematic review of the unpublished and published, peer-reviewed literature examining the relationship between interpersonal theory constructs and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, (b) conduct meta-analyses testing the interpersonal theory hypotheses, and (c) evaluate the influence of various moderators on these relationships. Four electronic bibliographic databases were searched through the end of March, 2016: PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Hypothesis-driven meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted using 122 distinct unpublished and published samples. Findings supported the interpersonal theory: the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness was significantly associated with suicidal ideation; and the interaction between thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide was significantly related to a greater number of prior suicide attempts. However, effect sizes for these interactions were modest. Alternative configurations of theory variables were similarly useful for predicting suicide risk as theory-consistent pathways. We conclude with limitations and recommendations for the interpersonal theory as a framework for understanding the suicidal spectrum. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Further, little research has sought to explore protective factors, such as identity pride, and their influence on this relationship. We examined the association between internalized transphobia and depression and anxiety symptoms among TGD youth and explored the moderating role of gender identity pride on these associations.  Methods  Participants were 315 TGD youth ages 12–20~years (mean~= 16; standard deviation~= 1.89) seeking gender-affirming hormone treatment at one of four major pediatric hospitals across the United States. At the time of enrollment, participants were naïve to gender-affirming hormone treatment. Participants self-reported mental health, internalized transphobia, and identity pride. Multiple regression models were used with depression and anxiety symptoms as outcomes and age, designated sex at birth, and perceived parental support included as covariates.  Results  Greater internalized transphobia was associated with greater depressive symptoms, and gender identity pride moderated this relationship, such that greater gender identity pride was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Greater internalized transphobia was significantly associated with greater anxiety symptoms; no moderation effect was observed for this relationship.  Discussion  Gender identity pride influenced mental health symptoms for youth experiencing internalized transphobia and represents a potential key protective factor. These results support efforts to further develop, test, and implement clinical inventions to bolster identity pride for TGD youth.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general method for sample size computations in the context of cross-sectional network models. The method takes the form of an automated Monte Carlo algorithm, designed to find an optimal sample size while iteratively concentrating the computations on the sample sizes that seem most relevant. The method requires three inputs: (1) a hypothesized network structure or desired characteristics of that structure, (2) an estimation performance measure and its corresponding target value (e.g., a sensitivity of 0.6), and (3) a statistic and its corresponding target value that determines how the target value for the performance measure be reached (e.g., reaching a sensitivity of 0.6 with a probability of 0.8). The method consists of a Monte Carlo simulation step for computing the performance measure and the statistic for several sample sizes selected from an initial candidate sample size range, a curve-fitting step for interpolating the statistic across the entire candidate range, and a stratified bootstrapping step to quantify the uncertainty around the recommendation provided. We evaluated the performance of the method for the Gaussian Graphical Model, but it can easily extend to other models.

  abstract = {The early months of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic exacerbated health disparities for vulnerable populations, including transgender (trans) communities, creating unique challenges for navigating sex and dating. This paper aims to expand upon the current literature regarding transmasculine populations by capturing their lived experiences during this critical time. We interviewed 20 assigned female sex at birth (AFAB) adults of the transmasculine spectrum - men, nonbinary, and transmasculine individuals - about their social and sexual experiences in the USA in May and June 2020. Transcripts were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. We found that sex drive decreased and uncertainty about health risks increased. Some participants found alternate ways to date and hook-up that reduced their COVID-19 risk, such as engaging in online sex (e.g. sexting, dating apps). Others expressed discomfort using virtual platforms for both personal/work and sexual lives, along with nuanced feelings around being objectified, compared to pornography, and fetishised as trans bodies. COVID-related shutdowns of queer spaces also amplified pre-existing concerns about interpersonal safety and rejection. When seeking new partners, participants sought behavioural characteristics that instilled trust. Future public health communications can take advantage of safety and sexual health strategies already present in trans communities to bolster wellbeing in trans lives.},

This work evaluates the psychometric properties of the French version of a questionnaire widely used internationally to measure perceived social support, which has not been yet validated in French: the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). This study collected data from 148 women (30.5 ± 5.12 years) who agreed to complete the MSPSS and a scale assessing symptoms of postpartum depression (Edinburgh Post-Natal Depression Scale, EPDS) 1 and 4 months after childbirth. The results confirm the original three-factor structure of the scale. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients are excellent. The total scale score is correlated with all three dimensions and a significantly negative correlation is found between MSPSS and EPDS. The results suggest that the French tool has generally good internal reliability. The MSPSS can provide useful data helping to identify French-speaking people at risk for negative feelings (e.g., mood disorders of perinatal period).},

These network models often contain significant numbers of unknown parameters, yet the sample sizes available in psychological research are limited. As such, general assumptions about the true network are introduced to reduce the number of free parameters. Incorporating these assumptions, however, means that the resulting network will lead to reflect the particular structure assumed by the estimation method—a crucial and often ignored aspect of psychopathological networks. For example, observing a sparse structure and simultaneously assuming a sparse structure does not imply that the true model is, in fact, sparse. To illustrate this point, we discuss recent literature and show the effect of the assumption of sparsity in three simulation studies.},

This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework latent network modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance–covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization residual network modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms perform adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study’s inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

A poorly investigated dimension in TGNC health research is perceived loneliness. Thus, within the minority stress theory, the present study aimed to investigate the mediating role of loneliness and the moderating role of social support in the relationship between internalized transphobia and psychological well-being among 79 Italian TGNC youths aged 18 to 30-years-old who participated in an online survey. The main results show that loneliness partially mediated the relationship between internalized transphobia and psychological well-being. In addition, social support emerged as a significant moderator, as the impact of internalized transphobia on psychological well-being decreased at moderate and high levels of social support, but not at low levels. The findings have significant implications for clinical practice and psychosocial interventions to reduce the impact of internalized stigma and stress on psychological health.},

Thematic analysis was used to generate themes and subthemes.

Results show that dating apps are an important tool used by trans/non-binary individuals to connect with others in the queer community and find platonic, romantic, and sexual partners. However, there are concerns about their use such as fears for safety and experiences of fetishization. More research, education, and implementations of app development, including the involvement of trans and non-binary people, are needed to address these concerns.},

  abstract = {Network Analysis is considered as a new method that challenges Latent Variable models in inferring psychological attributes. With Network Analysis, psychological attributes are derived from a complex system of components without the need to call on any latent variables. But the ontological status of psychological attributes is not adequately defined with Network Analysis, because a psychological attribute is both a complex system and a property emerging from this complex system. The aim of this article is to reappraise the legitimacy of latent variable models by engaging in an ontological and epistemological discussion on psychological attributes. Psychological attributes relate to the mental equilibrium of individuals embedded in their social interactions, as robust attractors within complex dynamic processes with emergent properties, distinct from physical entities located in precise areas of the brain. Latent variables thus possess legitimacy, because the emergent properties can be conceptualized and analyzed on the sole basis of their manifestations, without exploring the upstream complex system. However, in opposition with the usual Latent Variable models, this article is in favor of the integration of a dynamic system of manifestations. Latent Variables models and Network Analysis thus appear as complementary approaches. New approaches combining Latent Network Models and Network Residuals are certainly a promising new way to infer psychological attributes, placing psychological attributes in an inter-subjective dynamic approach. Pragmatism-realism appears as the epistemological framework required if we are to use latent variables as representations of psychological attributes.},

  abstract = {Pairwise network models such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) are a powerful and intuitive way to analyze dependencies in multivariate data. A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research, this is often implausible. In this article, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct MNMs and propose an ‘1-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate them. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation effects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate MNMs with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspecification.},

Questions have emerged about the extent to which psychologists are able to work competently with this population. This article presents a framework for understanding key clinical issues that psychologists who work with transgender and gender nonconforming individuals will likely encounter in their clinical work. This article does not address the knowledge and skills required to provide services related to gender transition, but rather to provide other psychological services that these clients may need, in light of the high levels of gender-related victimization and discrimination to which they are exposed. An adaptation of the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003) is presented and translated to incorporate the unique experiences encountered by transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. In particular, we examine adverse experiences that are closely related to gender identity and expression, resulting expectations for future victimization or rejection, and internalized transphobia. The impact of Minority Stress Model factors on suicide attempts is presented as a detailed example. Mechanisms by which transgender and gender nonconforming persons develop resilience to the negative psychological effects of these adverse experiences are also discussed. Recommendations for clinicians are then made to assist psychologists in developing competence in working with this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Selection bias is a general term describing bias that occurs when study participants are identified in a manner such that they are no longer representative of the target population. This can occur when an exposure and outcome each influence a common third variable—the collider—and that variable has been controlled for in the statistical analysis of the study data.

  abstract = {The Gaussian graphical model (GGM) has recently grown popular in psychological research, with a large body of estimation methods being proposed and discussed across various fields of study, and several algorithms being identified and recommend as applicable to psychological data sets. Such high-dimensional model estimation, however, is not trivial, and algorithms tend to perform differently in different settings. In addition, psychological research poses unique challenges, including placing a strong focus on weak edges (e.g., bridge edges), handling data measured on ordered scales, and relatively limited sample sizes. As a result, there is currently no consensus regarding which estimation procedure performs best in which setting. In this large-scale simulation study, we aimed to overcome this gap in the literature by comparing the performance of several estimation algorithms suitable for Gaussian and skewed ordered categorical data across a multitude of settings, as to arrive at concrete guidelines from applied researchers. In total, we investigated 60 different metrics across 564,000 simulated data sets. We summarized our findings through a platform that allows for manually exploring simulation results. Overall, we found that an exchange between discovery (e.g., sensitivity, edge weight correlation) and caution (e.g., specificity, precision) should always be expected, and achieving both-which is a requirement for perfect replicability-is difficult. Further, we identified that the estimation method is best chosen in light of each research question and have highlighted, alongside desirable asymptotic properties and low sample size discovery, results according to most common research questions in the field.

  abstract = {Transdisciplinarity has a long history of academic discourse. Promoted as an adequate scientific response to pressing societal problems like climate change, it has recently received common currency in science policy rhetoric. Nevertheless, despite its increasing popularity, transdisciplinarity is still far from academically established and current funding practices do not effectively support it at universities and research institutions. One reason for this deficit is that a universally accepted definition for transdisciplinarity is still not available. Consequently, quality standards that equally guide researchers, program managers and donors are widely lacking. Therefore, a rhetorical mainstreaming of transdisciplinarity prevails which risks marginalizing those who take seriously the integrative efforts creative collaboration requires. The aim of this paper is thus to find common ground in the transdisciplinarity discourse. Based on an analysis of current scientific literature, we first identify main features of an emerging shared framework of transdisciplinarity. Second, building upon this framework, we present a conceptual model of transdisciplinarity that can be used by science and science policy to characterize different types of transdisciplinarity and their corresponding demands on integration. We also address the way in which ecological economics could benefit from adopting this model. To conclude, we propose a general definition of transdisciplinarity.},

Experiences of minority stress and thwarted belongingness may contribute to elevated risk, and be most pernicious among persons with multiple marginalized identities. The present study sought to examine the relation between gender identity (cisgender vs. transgender and nonbinary individuals [TNB]) and recent SI among a convenience sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, and queer adults. Participants (  N\,=  \,807) completed an online survey with measures of minority stress, SI, and thwarted belongingness. We tested a mediation model in which TNB identity was indirectly associated with SI via minority stress (  β  \,=\,1.94,   SE  \,=\,0.30, Bootstrap 95\% CI = [1.39, 2.58]). We also investigated thwarted belongingness as a moderator between minority stress and SI, and found evidence of a two-way interaction (  β  \,=\,0.01,   SE  \,=\,0.001,   p  \,{$<$}\,.001). The conditional indirect effect of gender identity on SI through minority stress was higher for individuals with higher levels of thwarted belongingness (  β  \,=\,0.07,   SE  \,=\,0.02, Bootstrap 95\% CI = [0.04, 0.11]). Gender identity was indirectly associated with SI through minority stress and elevations in minority stress were associated with more frequent SI. The minority stress and SI association was strongest for participants reporting higher thwarted belongingness. Building and maintaining strong social support networks may be especially important for persons with intersecting gender and sexual minority identities who face minority stress.  TNB gender identity was indirectly associated with SI via minority stress Thwarted belongingness moderated the relation between minority stress and SI The minority stress SI relation was strongest at higher thwarted belongingness},

Our objectives were to assess the PHQ-8 as a depression measure in a large, epidemiological population-based study, and to determine the comparability of depression as defined by the PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm vs. a PHQ-8 cutpoint ≥ 10. Methods: Random-digit-dialed telephone survey of 198,678 participants in the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), a population-based survey in the United States. Current depression as defined by either the DSM-IV based diagnostic algorithm (i.e., major depressive or other depressive disorder) of the PHQ-8 or a PHQ-8 score ≥10; respondent sociodemographic characteristics; number of days of impairment in the past 30 days in multiple domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: The prevalence of current depression was similar whether defined by the diagnostic algorithm or a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10 (9.1\% vs. 8.6\%). Depressed patients had substantially more days of impairment across multiple domains of HRQoL, and the impairment was nearly identical in depressed groups defined by either method. Of the 17,040 respondents with a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10, major depressive disorder was present in 49.7\%, other depressive disorder in 23.9\%, depressed mood or anhedonia in another 22.8\%, and no evidence of depressive disorder or depressive symptoms in only 3.5\%. Limitations: The PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm rather than an independent structured psychiatric interview was used as the criterion standard. Conclusions: The PHQ-8 is a useful depression measure for population-based studies, and either its diagnostic algorithm or a cutpoint ≥10 can be used for defining current depression. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we test a syndemic model of the relationship between these three mental health conditions in the context of economic deprivation and interpersonal discrimination. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We used data on substance use, depressive symptoms, suicidality, and social–structural factors from 2680 TGD youth captured in the 2017 and 2019 survey waves of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. We used a latent class analysis (LCA) to identify groups with distinct patterns of self-reported substance use and depressive symptoms, and regression models to characterize the relationship between substance-use, depressive symptoms, class membership, social–structural factors, and suicidality. Results\hspace{0.6em} A three-class LCA solution identified a subset of student respondents in a “high use” latent class characterized by high self-reported substance use frequency and depressive symptoms compared with other classes. Online bullying (aOR: 1.58; 95\% CI: 1.28–1.95) and housing insecurity (aOR: 8.78; 95\% CI: 4.35–17.71) were associated with increased odds of “high use” class membership relative to the “no use” class membership. “High use” class membership was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR: 2.26; 95\% CI: 1.75–2.94), plans (aOR: 2.59; 95\% CI: 2.01–3.36), and attempts (aOR: 6.85; 95\% CI: 3.17–15.68). Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} The co-occurrence of substance use and depressive symptoms is associated with socio-structural factors and may drive risk for suicidality among TGD youth. Meaningful suicide prevention efforts that address disproportionate risk in this population must be attentive to and mitigate the shared determinants of mood symptoms and substance use behavior.},

These functions were coded in the qualitative research related to minority stress for TNB people over the last five years. Findings revealed that most interpersonal functions of gender examined were described rarely, especially those associated with TNB communities of color. Damage-centered perspectives were common.

Bisexual women demonstrated the lowest body esteem, while pansexual women exhibited lower body satisfaction versus heterosexual, lesbian and questioning women. Body change behaviours did not differ among women, but weight loss attempts were elevated in gay and bisexual men. Comfort with sexuality, resilience and social support were positively associated with body esteem.

We hypothesized that gender-affirming hormonal interventions and greater social support would be associated with lower levels of mental health concerns.  Methods  Participants (  n  ~= 75; aged 11–18;   M  age  ~= 16.39~years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study from a gender-affirming multidisciplinary clinic. Fifty-two percent were receiving gender-affirming hormonal interventions. Surveys assessed anxiety and depressive symptoms, NSSI and suicidality in the past year, and social support from family, friends, and significant others. Hierarchical linear regression models examined associations between gender-affirming hormonal interventions and social support (i.e., family, friend) with mental health while accounting for nonbinary gender identity.  Results  Regression models explained 15\%–23\% of variance in TNB adolescents' mental health outcomes. Gender-affirming hormonal interventions were associated with fewer anxiety symptoms (  β  ~=~−0.23;   p   {$<$} .05). Family support was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (  β  ~=~−0.33;   p  ~= .003) and less NSSI (  β  ~=~−0.27;   p  ~= .02). Friend support was associated with fewer anxiety symptoms (  β  ~=~−0.32;   p  ~= .007) and less suicidality (  β  ~=~−0.25;   p  ~= .03).  Discussion  TNB adolescents had better mental health outcomes in the context of receiving gender-affirming hormonal interventions and having greater support from family and friends. Findings highlight the important role of quality family and friend support for TNB mental health. Providers should aim to address   both   medical and social factors to optimize TNB mental health outcomes.},

Syndemic theory has been used as a framework to study the health of MSM for nearly 20 years. However, the literature is plagued by a lack of consensus regarding what constitutes a synergy in a syndemic and recent reviews have shown that most of the papers published thus far have failed to demonstrate a synergy nor describe the bio-social interaction needed to account for a true syndemic. Moreover, to our knowledge, none of the existing reviews have focused specifically on MSM. This scoping review aims to fill this gap by mapping in detail how syndemic research on MSM has been conducted. A systematic database search was conducted between 2020 and 2021 and 115 studies were included. Our findings showed a lack of diversity regarding the location, design, subpopulation, and outcomes studied. In addition, the syndemic conditions, as well as their measurement, were not focused enough to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of the findings. Furthermore, our results support previous reviews showing a lack of empirical data to support disease interaction in syndemic research applied to MSM. Our review offers some important recommendations to help move the field forward in future work and describes some promising methodological advances.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Growing data on suicidal behavior among members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and other sexual/gender minority (LGBTQ+) communities, particularly in the transgender subgroup, demonstrate that there is a stark elevation in suicidality compared with rates in their cisgender counterparts. Among the available theories of suicide, the interpersonal theory of suicide (IPTS) is a plausible explanation for the increased suicidal behaviors among transgender youths.         Objective:~         The objective of this study was to examine the pathologic basis of treatment-resistant suicidality in transgender youth despite favorable environments using the theoretical framework of the IPTS, supported by a literature review and case series.         Methods:~         We conducted a literature review using PubMed and PsycInfo with key words suicidal ideation, suicidality, transgender, transgender youth, gender dysphoria, and interpersonal theory of suicide. Seventy-eight articles were retrieved, which were then narrowed down to 30 articles after non-English articles and irrelevant topics were excluded. The clinical presentations of 5 transgender youths, 11 to 17 years of age, were found to be correlated with relevant reports in the research literature, implying a plausible rationale for elevated rates of suicide. All patients and families supplied verbal consent for these case reports to be published.         Results:~         Reasons for suicidal behavior among the patients included thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness leading to perpetual suicidal behavior. The presence in these cases of the following contributing factors in the IPTS—thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability for suicide—suggests that such a basis exists. Perceived burdensomeness appears to have a greater correlation with developing suicidal behavior than thwarted belongingness alone, but the presence of both demonstrates the highest risk of suicidality in transgender youth. Transgender children and adolescents are at extremely high risk of suicidal behavior, but little research has been devoted to the etiology and plausible explanations for this elevated risk, despite growing awareness of and support for the problem. This review suggests further research is required on the triadic factor interactions of the IPTS model that could help us to better understand and intervene with this high-risk population.},

A latent class analysis modeled six binary health indicators (depression, alcohol use, current smoking, asthma, physical inactivity, overweight status) to identify clusters of presenting health issues.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Four clusters of health indicators emerged: (a) depression; (b) syndemic (all indicators); (c) alcohol use, overweight status; and (d) smoking, physical inactivity, overweight status. Transphobic discrimination in health care and avoiding care were each associated with membership in the syndemic class. Qualitative themes included personal health care needs, community needs, and resilience and protective factors.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Findings fill an important gap about the health of transmasculine communities, including the need for public health efforts that holistically address concomitant health concerns.},

This emergent approach to health conception and clinical practice reconfigures conventional historical understanding of diseases as distinct entities in nature, separate from other diseases and independent of the social contexts in which they are found. Rather, all of these factors tend to interact synergistically in various and consequential ways, having a substantial impact on the health of individuals and whole populations. Specifically, a syndemics approach examines why certain diseases cluster (ie, multiple diseases affecting individuals and groups); the pathways through which they interact biologically in individuals and within populations, and thereby multiply their overall disease burden, and the ways in which social environments, especially conditions of social inequality and injustice, contribute to disease clustering and interaction as well as to vulnerability. In this Series, the contributions of the syndemics approach for understanding both interacting chronic diseases in social context, and the implications of a syndemics orientation to the issue of health rights, are examined.},

Greater numbers of health problems are significantly and positively associated with high-risk sexual behavior and HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS AIDS prevention among MSM has overwhelmingly focused on sexual risk alone. Other health problems among MSM not only are important in their own right, but also may interact to increase HIV risk. HIV prevention might become more effective by addressing the broader health concerns of MSM while also focusing on sexual risks.},

The theory takes a life course perspective on the development of health problems among gay men, and describes the development of these problems as a syndemic process of interacting health problems that begin at an early age among gay male adolescents. The current dominant explanations for lower health profiles among gay men are that homophobia causes poor health in men. This chapter adds to that explanation the possibility that the lifelong effects of experiencing homophobic violence and cultural marginalization at a very early age is a centrally-important force in syndemic production among gay men. © 2008 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

This study was conducted to develop and evaluate the validity of a tool to better assess these constructs in TGNC populations. The Gender Minority Stress and Resilience (GMSR) measure was developed grounded on Meyer’s minority stress model, and adjusted to reflect the experiences of TGNC populations based on TGNC literature and archival data from TGNC focus groups. The final GMSR includes scales assessing 9 constructs: gender-related discrimination, gender-related rejection, gender-related victimization, nonaffirmation of gender identity, internalized transphobia, negative expectations for future events, nondisclosure, community connectedness, and pride. In the current study, 844 participants completed the GMSR measure as well as measures related to mental health, general life stress, and social support. Results indicated good model fit, criterion validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity for the 9 hypothesized scales. Discriminant validity for the scales were also partially supported. Overall, the current study offers preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the GMSR Measure for use with TGNC populations. The GMSR Measure has several uses for both research and clinical purposes, including increasing understanding of the experiences and correlates of gender minority stress and resilience factors and assessing whether specific therapies or interventions are helpful in reducing risk and supporting resilience in TGNC populations.},

This study aims to analyze the role of factors from the gender minority stress and resilience (GMSR) model (Testa, Habarth, Peta, Balsam, \& Bockting, 2015), the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010), and the potential integration of these factors, in explaining SI in this population. A convenience sample of 816 TGNC adults responded to measures of current SI, gender minority stressors, and IPTS factors. Path analysis was utilized to test 2 models. Model 1 evaluated the associations between external minority stressors and SI through internal minority stressors. Model 2 examined the relationships between internal minority stressors and SI through IPTS variables (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness). All GMSR external stressors (rejection, nonaffirmation, victimization, and discrimination), internal stressors (internalized transphobia, negative expectations, and nondisclosure), and IPTS factors (thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) were related to SI. Both models demonstrated good fit. Model 1 revealed that rejection, nonaffirmation, and victimization were related to SI through experiences of internalized transphobia and negative expectations. Model 2 indicated that internalized transphobia and negative expectations were associated with SI through IPTS factors. The models demonstrate pathways through which GMSR and IPTS constructs relate to one another and confer risk for SI among TGNC individuals. These pathways and several recently proposed constructs examined here provide promising directions for future research and clinical interventions in this area.},

  abstract = {Aims  Masculinity is a driving factor in health behaviors of cisgender men; however, there is little research about conceptualizations of masculinity and their impact on health behaviors among transmasculine populations. This study sought to construct a theoretical framework for masculine identity development in transmasculine individuals in the United States, and the impact this process has on their health behaviors, specifically alcohol and tobacco use.  Methods  Twenty-four in-depth interviews were conducted as part of the Masculinity and Self-Conceptualization Study (MASCS). We analyzed the data using grounded theory.  Results  Transmasculine individuals iteratively drafted, questioned, and revised their masculinity. Alcohol and tobacco and other harmful health behaviors associated with traditional masculinity were often featured in early drafts of masculine identity as tools of gender affirmation. As participants grew into their masculinity and began being affirmed in their gender through legal, social, or medical means, their reliance on negative health behaviors as a gender affirmation tool often decreased.  Conclusion  Harmful health behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use featured prominently into early transition or masculine identity adoption for many transmasculine individuals in this study, and they frequently conceptualized engaging with alcohol and tobacco as a behavior that allowed them to access masculinity. Substance use interventions for transmasculine individuals should move away from a framework that focuses on alcohol, tobacco, and other negative health behaviors solely as a coping mechanism for cissexist stigma and trauma, toward a framework that supports transmasculine individuals in strengthening alternative tools to explore and affirm gender to prevent and reduce substance use. The Masculine Identity Development framework has the potential to be applied to other negative health behaviors and can identify the associations between adopted masculine characteristics and negative health outcomes.},

All items were grouped into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting. Duplicate items and those that were ambiguous, too broadly defined and impractical to assess were removed.Items most frequently included in the checklists related to sampling method, setting for data collection, method of data collection, respondent validation of findings, method of recording data, description of the derivation of themes and inclusion of supporting quotations. We grouped all items into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting.The criteria included in COREQ, a 32-item checklist, can help researchers to report important aspects of the research team, study methods, context of the study, findings, analysis and interpretations.},

Among the widely used instruments for measuring global self-esteem, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale (RSE) has displayed high levels of validity and reliability (Harter 1983; Wylie 1974). Through a brief (10 items) and direct approach, the RSE can be answered quickly by different age and social groups. Considering the good psychometric properties of the RSE mentioned above, and the importance of self-esteem for research in psychology, the purpose of the present four studies was to translate and validate in French the RSE Internal consistency (study 1) and confirmatory factor analyses through LISREL VI (study 2) were conducted with a French-Canadian junior college student population in order to verify the internal consistency and the unidimensional factorial structure of the scale. In addition, the construct validity (study 3) and temporal stability (study 4) of the scale were assessed. Although the present findings are preliminary in nature, they nevertheless support the reliability and validity of the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale in French.},

For some LGBTQ+ commentators, “twink” has become relexified to mean a young-looking, slim, hairless effeminate bottom, whereas originally the term primarily denoted a body type and age bracket among gay men. This article explores how the twink has come to bear connotations of effeminacy and bottom subjectivity, highlighting the steady erosion of other available cultural terms to denote a bottom whose gender expression does not conform to dominant cultural masculine stereotypes. It offers an analysis of two key historical effeminate bottom identities in Britain and the US, the “fairy” and “queen,” and argues that the twink not only now carries connotations originally attached to these historical identities, but that it merges their gendered and sexual connotations with new characteristics concerning age and body type that may cause considerable anxiety among contemporary gay men due to their unsustainable “shelf life.”},

These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.},

  abstract = { HIV transmission patterns have shifted over time. In 2015, most cases of HIV occurred through male-to-male sexual contact (67\%). 19 An additional 3\% of diagnoses occurred among gay and bisexual men with a history of injection drug use. 20 Diagnoses attributable to injection drug use alone have declined significantly over time, decreasing 63\% between 2005 and 2014, and accounted for 6\% of new diagnoses in 2015. 21,22 Transmission through heterosexual sex now accounts for more cases than at the beginning of the epidemic – 24\% of new diagnoses in 2015 – but diagnoses attributable to heterosexual sex have declined 35\% between 2005 and 2014. 23,24  HIV testing is important for both treatment and prevention efforts and rapid testing is now much more widely available. Yet, 13\% of those infected with HIV are unaware they are infected. 25 Routine HIV testing is recommended for all people ages 13-64, 26 and several recent policies have expanded health insurance coverage of HIV testing. 27  Current U.S. HIV treatment guidelines recommend initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as one is diagnosed with HIV, 28 and new research (including the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment study or START) has underscored the importance of starting treatment early. 29 Further, research has shown the prevention benefits of treatment, including that when an individual living with HIV is on antiretroviral therapy and the level of HIV in their body is " durably suppressed " , the risk of sexual transmission can be " negligible. " 30,31  However, looking across the spectrum from HIV diagnosis to viral suppression reveals missed opportunities for addressing the epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while many people with HIV are diagnosed (87\%), far fewer are retained in medical care (56.5\% of those diagnosed) and fewer still are virally suppressed (55\% of those diagnosed).},
